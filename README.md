Thank you for using my software! This software is provided to you for personal and non-commercial use only.

This is 100% a passion project and is constantly being worked on. All updates regarding offsets will be posted here. 

Details: This build is a heavily modified version of the software made by iStar.

This project includes the following improvements. (2/12/2025)

- Uncapped FPS and rendering
- ImGui usage
- MiniMap / Radar
- Snap lines
- Box and Bone ESP
- Healthbars
- Full Mouse only support
- New Style
- Aimbot through the usage of Kmbox.NET devices
* The Aimbot is buggy (working on solutions) and also uses World to Screen as of the current patch.
* This means that it DOES NOT have prediction and also does not scale over distance.
* When using Aimbot, be sure to use the correct Reticle Offset for your weapon. A tool tip when hovering over the slider shows manually tested values.

Aimkey is now choosable through a dropdown menu. No Recoil works without Aimbot. <strike> Update for dynamic input is coming soon </strike>



## ESP
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4547d41-4e24-4350-8a3a-3c98a12b2258)

- Hide Team - This will hide wether or not your teammates are on ESP / targeted with Aimbot
- Show Type - This shows wether the enemy is AI or Player.
- Spectaor Count - This shows all spectators currently watching you, including teammates
- Distance - Shows distance in Meters, along with a slider to change text size and a color picker.
- Max Distance - This limits the ESP render range, again in Meters.
- Mini Map - Normal is the standard small corner minimap, Enlarged is the larger minimap. Color pickers for self and enemy.
- Bones - This renders Bone style ESP, along with color picker. Also has a slider to increase bone thickness
- Boxes - Box style ESP. Box warps size based on standing, crouched, or proned, along with color picker
- Player Lines - Also known as Snap Lines, this draws lines from the bottom of your screen to the player, along with color 
  picker
- Healthbars - Shows how much health remaining in an arcade style fashion. Can select Top or Bottom for horizontal health 
  bar, and Left or Right for vertical health bar.
- Dynamic Color - This gives you 2 color pickers, that will change the color of the bones based on 75% and 25% health. 
  Color picker allows you to use custom colors. Default colors are Yellow for 75% and Red for 25% health.

## Aimbot / No Recoil

# Important Aimbot Information
- Connect on Start-up - This auto runs the function during the launch of the program, automatically connecting the Kmbox. 
  Be sure to go to Settings and press Save Config to ensure that it is enabled on next start-up.
- Aimkey - this is a drop down menu that allows for the choosing of Left Mouse, Right Mouse, Middle Mouse, Side Button 1, 
  and Side Button 2 to be used for the Aimbot / No Recoil key. The Aimkey is a Dual Input, so Aimbot and No Recoil are 
  both bound to it. This mean you can enable Aimbot and have No Recoil as well, Disable No Recoil and just have Aimbot, or 
  disable Aimbot and simply just have No Recoil.
- Connect - This button connects your Kmbox.NET manually, your IP, Port, and UUID will be displayed next to it, ensure 
  these details are correct before attempting to connect or the program will crash.
- Smoothness - Time in ms to for center of FOV circle to reach target. Lower = snappier
- Max Distance - The maximum distance to scan for targets within the FOV Circle
- Reticle Offset - This is a per gun value, that is directly tied to the in-game Muzzle Rize mechanic that brings
  The reticle away from the center of the screen. Hover for Tool Tip information about what values are recommended
- Target Bone - You can choose from Head, Neck, Upper Chest, Center Mass, and Pelvis. This determines what bone to target.
- Draw FOV / FOV Color - this determines the color of the FOV Circle or wether or not to draw it.
  Disabling <ins> does not </ins> disable the Aimbot.
- FOV Size - This detemines the size of the circle, the larger the number, the larger the diameter
- No Recoil - This pulls the mouse down with a script that also scans for Q and E presses to compensate for lean.
  Higher the value, the more powerful the script is.


## Settings 

- Save config to file, along with load config so you can mess around with the settings and always go back to preferred 
  settings when re-launching the program. 
- Themes - There is a dark theme pictured above, along with a light theme. Dark theme is Orange on Dark Grey, Light theme 
  is Baby Blue on White. More themes can be made upon request in Issues.
- Exit App - This button exits the application safely. You can also press Home + End at the same time.
- Show FPS - This shows the current FPS of the menu. Due to the way it is written, 10,000+ FPS is standard.
- Credits - Crediting those who helped me along the way.
