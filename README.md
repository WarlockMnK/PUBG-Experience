Thank you for using my software! This software is provided to you for personal and non-commercial use only.

This is 100% a passion project and is constantly being worked on. All updates regarding offsets will be posted here. 

Details: This build is a heavily modified version of the software made by iStar.

This project includes the following improvements. (2/12/2025)

- Uncapped FPS and rendering
- ImGui usage
- MiniMap / Radar
- Snap lines
- Box ESP
- Healthbars
- Full Mouse only support
- New Style
- Aimbot through the usage of Kmbox Net devices
* The Aimbot is buggy (working on solutions) and also uses World to Screen as of the current patch.
* This means that it DOES NOT have prediction and also does not scale over distance.
* When using Aimbot, be sure to use the correct Reticle Offset for your weapon. A tool tip when hovering over the slider shows manually tested values.

Aimkey is now choosable through a dropdown menu. No Recoil works without Aimbot. <strike> Update for dynamic input is coming soon </strike>

To do / Future Improvements
- [] Item ESP
- [] Prediction / View angle based Aimbot
- [] Engine improvement
- [] Better entity caching
- [] Controller support
- [] Kmbox B+ support
- [] Memory aim (if UE supports it)
- [] Visibility Check
